The slide deck id refers to a file in the *Source* folder.
5. postprocess.py: Hides irrelevant slides based on the consumption. <code>python postprocess.py --[endpoint https://myinstance.openai.azure.com/] --key [AOAI endpoint key] [--customer customer.txt] 2024_08</code>. The slide deck id refers to a file in the *Annotated* folder.
